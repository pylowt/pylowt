## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**pylowt/pylowt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing microservices in Python and Go with RPC, gRPC, Pub/Sub and REST
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, Java and C
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any type of project but particularly in Go or something with software synths (VSTs)
